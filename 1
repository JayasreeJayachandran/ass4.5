1.Checksum 
   > A checksum or hash sum is a small-size datum from a block of digital data for the purpose of detecting errors 
   which may have been introduced during its transmission or storage.
   >HDFS checksums all data written to it and by default verifies checksums when reading data.
   > A separate checksum is created for every dfs.bytes-per-checksum bytes of data.
   >The default is 512 bytes, and because a CRC-32C checksum is 4 bytes long. The storage overhead is less than 1%.
   > Datanodes are responsible for verifying the data they receive before storing the data and its checksum.
   >When the clients read data from datanodes, they verify checksums as well, comparing them with the ones at the datanodes.
   >-get command does the checksum verification during the data read.
   >-copyFromLocal doesnâ€™t perform checksum during data read.
   > -ignoreCrc option with the -get is equivalent to -copyToLocal command.
   > Disabling checksum verification is useful if we have a corrupt file that we want to inspect .
