Handling Failures During Writing a File:
      >At first,the pipelines are closed and the left packets on ack queue are placed on the data pipeline 
      so that the loss of data packets does not occur.
      >Now,the current new datanode is given new identity and then the failed datanode is deleted in 
      case of failure of recovering the damaged nodes data.
      >The failed datanode is removed from the pipeline by replacing it in the good namenode.
      >Then the namenode checks whether its under replicaion and completes the replication process and 
      follows the next block normally.
